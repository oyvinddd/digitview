  s.description      = <<-DESC
  UIView subclass that wraps separate UITextFields to create a custom digit input view. The delegate method didFinishInput(_ input: String) should be added to the view controller containing the digit view. The method will get called when the user has inserted a digit into every input field in the digit view.
